/// # Implementation Contract
///
/// [`Guard`] consumers **may** delay dropping them arbitrarily, so [`Guard`] producers **should not** rely on that for correctness.
///
/// [`Guard`] consumers **should not** leak them, as [`Guard`] producers **may** leak memory in such a case.
///
/// > These are strong suggestions, since those "**may**"s are likely to be quite common.
/// >
/// > For example, a double-buffering differ running in a browser, as of writing e.g. [lignin-dom](https://docs.rs/lignin-dom/latest/lignin_dom/),
/// > will always delay dropping past the rendering of the updated VDOM.
/// >
/// > On a server, it may make sense to create an atomically- and periodically updated cache for part of the page,
/// > if it renders very slowly for some reason. (I.e. an app could render out a VDOM while calculating or retrieving data synchronously, even if it *probably shouldn't*.)
/// >
/// > In terms of leaks, a good example is subtree caching, which due to delayed [`Guard`] drops **must** store any number of states as necessary or panic if it won't/can't at some point.
