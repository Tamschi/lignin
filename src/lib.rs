#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! `lignin`, named after the structural polymer found in plants, is a lightweight but comprehensive VDOM data type library for use in a wider web context.
//!
//! # About the Documentation
//!
//! DOM API terms are ***bold italic*** and linked to the MDN Web Docs.
//! (Please file an issue if this isn't the case somewhere.)
//!
//! # Implementation Contract
//!
//! > **This is not a soundness contract**. Code using this crate must not rely on it for soundness.
//! > However, it is free to panic when encountering an incorrect implementation.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! See also the implementation contracts on [`Node::Text::text`], [`Node::Comment::comment`] and [`Attribute::name`].
//!
//! When rendering the VDOM as HTML text, extra care **must** be taken to syntactically validate everything according to [the specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html)!
//!
//! HTML renderers should error rather than panic when encountering a VDOM that they can't guarantee will be parsed as intended (assuming any syntax errors potentially cause undefined behavior *somewhere*).  
//! However, renderers are free to be lenient in this regard by adjusting their output to be syntactically valid in a way that's unlikely to cause a changed user experience. (That is: Feel free to substitute illegal character sequences in comments and such.)
//!
//! ## Correctness
//!
//! The DOM may contain extra siblings past the nodes mentioned in the VDOM. Renderers must ignore them.
//!
//! Similarly, the DOM may contain extra attributes and event bindings. Renderers must ignore them unless attributes collide.  
//! Components must clean up extra attributes and event listeners they have previous added to the DOM via the DOM API on teardown.
//!
//! > This simplifies renderers and allows reuse of DOM nodes between components, which in turn reduces the amount of DOM API calls necessary.
//!
//! See also the implementation contracts on [`DomRef`] and [`Node::Keyed`].
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! While the order of [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes) reported by the DOM API in browsers isn't specified and event listeners can't be examined this way,
//! components *should* stick to a relatively consistent order here and place conditional attributes and event bindings past always present ones in the respective slices.
//!
//! When adding or removing [`Node`]s dynamically between updates, components should wrap lists in [`Node::Multi`] and otherwise insert an empty [`Node::Multi([&[])`](`Node::Multi`) as placeholder for an absent element.
//!
//! > Each of these suggestions allows better and easier diff optimization in renderers, but otherwise mustn't be a strict requirement for compatibility.
//!
//! # Deep Comparisons
//!
//! All [`core`] comparison traits ([`PartialEq`], [`Eq`], [`PartialOrd`] and [`Ord`]) are implemented recursively where applicable.
//!
//! Note that [`CallbackRef`]s derived from separate instances of [`CallbackRegistration`] are still considered distinct,
//! regardless of the `receiver` and `handler` used to make them.
//! However, without the `"callbacks"` feature, all [`CallbackRef`] instances are inactive **and indistinct**.
//!
//! For shallow comparisons, access and compare fields directly or [memoize](`Node::Memoized`) parts of the GUI.
//!
//! # Notes on Performance
//!
//! ## Clone
//!
//! [`Clone`] is always implemented via [`Copy`] in this crate, since none of the instances provide heap storage.
//!
//! ## Comparisons and Hashing
//!
//! As shallow hashes would easily collide for most applications where VDOM hashing comes up,
//! [`Hash`](`core::hash::Hash`) is implemented recursively in this crate and is potentially expensive.
//! The same applies to [`PartialEq`], [`Eq`], [`PartialOrd`] and [`Ord`].
//!
//! As an exception, [`Node::Memoized`] instances are compared only by their [`state_key`](`Node::Memoized::state_key`).
//! Their [`content`](`Node::Memoized::content`) is ignored for comparisons and does not factor into their [hash](`core::hash`).
//!
//! **`lignin` does not implement hash caching by itself**, so users of [`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) or similar containers should wrap node graphs in a "`HashCached<T>`" type first.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! As `lignin` targets HTML and DOM rather than XML, it does not support [***processing instructions***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ProcessingInstruction) or [***CDATA sections***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CDATASection).
//!
//! For the same reason, there is formally no information about VDOM identity, which could be used to render self-referential XML documents.
//!
//! > In practice, it **may** be possible to determine identity by comparing pointers, but this would require some workarounds regarding `lignin`'s slices-of-values to be general.
//! >
//! > The implementation itself would be quite error-prone on types that are [`Copy`] due to implicit by-value copies there. Proceed with caution if you must!
//!
//! Element and attribute names are always plain `&str`s, which isn't ideal for software that renders its GUI more directly than through a web browser.
//! I'm open to maintaining a generic fork if there's interest in this regard.
//!
//! While the `"callbacks"` feature is disabled, all callback management is erased.
//! This makes `lignin` faster and removes usage limits, but removes unique identities from [`CallbackRegistration`] and [`CallbackRef`], which affects comparisons and hashing.
//!
//! [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) support is rudimentary due lack of direct support in web-sys.
